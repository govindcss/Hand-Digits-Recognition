# hand-digits-recognition
1. We must first design a sequential Keras model that builds a layer stack.
2. Then, use MNIST data to train the model, then save it as "model_train" in the "Main.py" file.
3. After loading ‘model_train’, run the "project.py" in VScode to start making predictions using this trained model.
4. A prompt will show up requesting your input for saved or live video.
5. The saved video is " Govind_Chennu_testing.mp4". The model will process the video and output it as "processed_video_output.avi" with recognized digits.
6. Instead of option 1 you can choose option 2 which takes live video input from the webcam, process the video recognizes the digits, and saves it as “webcam_live_output.avi”.
7. All the output videos are stored in the created environment ‘project’.
